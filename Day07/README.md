### Python for Everybody-  Using Python to Access Web Data - Coursera
Today i am learning from python for everybody |  Using Python to Access Web Data | Coursera Course.
What i **learn** Today:
- ASCII
- Unicode


# Using Python to Access Web Data
All the class code is in [Class_Code.ipynb](https://github.com/shahabbukhari/Python-30-Days/blob/master/Day07/Class_Code.ipynb) .class code file is a notebook file it also includes the **assignments** with output.

## The ASCII Character Set:
ASCII stands for the "American Standard Code for Information Interchange". It was designed in the early 60's, as a standard character set for computers and electronic devices. ASCII is a 7-bit character set containing 128 characters. It contains the numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case English letters from A to Z, and some special characters. The character sets used in modern computers, in HTML, and on the Internet, are all based on ASCII.

### Check ASCII code of any character in python:-
```python
print(ord('A'))
<!-- 48 -->
```
There is a problem with ASCII they just represents these character not more so the problems occurs jappense computer does not tlak to american computers and american computer also not able to talk with japenes computers. 

## Unicode:
Unicode is an information technology (IT) standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and as of March 2020, there is a total of 143,859 characters, with Unicode 13.0 (these characters consist of 143,696 graphic characters and 163 format characters) covering 154 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji. The character repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646, and both are code-for-code identical.
You can find all sort of unicode characters [here](https://home.unicode.org/)
