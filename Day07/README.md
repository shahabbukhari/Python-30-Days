## The ASCII Character Set
ASCII stands for the "American Standard Code for Information Interchange". It was designed in the early 60's, as a standard character set for computers and electronic devices. ASCII is a 7-bit character set containing 128 characters. It contains the numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case English letters from A to Z, and some special characters. The character sets used in modern computers, in HTML, and on the Internet, are all based on ASCII.
